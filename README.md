To facilitate uploading and downloading, the data has been compressed.
This repository contains data at 7 different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.
Each SNR level includes a corresponding training dataset and testing dataset.
The files are named data_train_noise_xx_dB.zip and data_test_noise_xx_dB.zip, where xx represents the specific SNR value.
